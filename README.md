I am no C++ expert, or coding expert for that matter, but this is a Template that I made in C++ which finds
the mode of any type array. The mode is the most common occurring element in an array, or the element that 
occurs the most. The Template first uses a selection sort algorithm to sort the array, and then uses another
algorithm, which looks very similar to the selections sort to find the most common occurrence. This value is
returned to the caller.


There is a main function here just so there can be a functioning program with demonstration. The main method 
passes a string of array, and a string of int. The mode is returned for each.
